    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

However, this is one piece of the puzzle.  Performing a categorical analysis implies a p-value of 3.85e-5, which is statistically significant.  This means that we may reject the null hypothesis.  If there is little to no discrimination, then the mean callbacks between races would be equal.  However, it is not.  The difference, in favor of European Americans, shows 95% confidence that they would get between 1% to 50%.  This validates the earlier (and quicker claim) that European Americans are twice as likely to get callbacks than African Americans.  However, callback is one story to the puzzle!\n"

These may include skillset, behaviorals (i.e. whether the manager prefers this candidate because they are easy to work with), and everything in between.  They could imply different types of jobs that the company was planning to hire and how skills, background, and credentials may have played a role.\n",

Other values would divide it based on job types; whether it is equal count that the number of black managers are equivalent to the number of white ones.
